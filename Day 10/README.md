### Description

The Calculator program is a versatile tool for performing simple arithmetic calculations. Here's what you can do with it:

1. **Basic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Continuous Calculations**: After each calculation, you can choose to continue using the result for the next operation or start a completely new calculation.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**: The program features an eye-catching ASCII art logo and provides clear instructions for each step of the calculation process.

4. **Flexible and Error-Resistant**: The calculator handles various user inputs, including invalid operators or numbers, gracefully and prompts users to enter valid values.

This project combines several important programming concepts, including functions with outputs, docstrings, while loops, flags, and recursion. It provides a practical application of Python's capabilities to create a user-friendly tool.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the first number, select an operation, enter the second number, and see the result.
3. After each calculation, you have the option to continue with the result or start a new calculation.
4. To exit the program, simply choose not to continue after a calculation.

Enjoy using your Python calculator for all your basic arithmetic needs!
