# Day 4 - Randomisation and Python Lists 🎲

## Overview

In this session, we dive into the concept of randomization and working with Python lists. We explore the use of the random module for generating random choices and gain a better understanding of lists, including appending items and handling index errors. The primary focus is on creating a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

### Description

The Rock Paper Scissors project brings the classic hand game to life in Python. Users play against the computer by choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer generates its choice randomly. The program then determines the winner based on the rules of the game. It's a simple yet engaging project that demonstrates randomization and list manipulation in Python.

### How it Works

Here's a high-level overview of how the Rock Paper Scissors game works:

1. **ASCII Art**: The program starts by defining ASCII art representations for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

2. **User Input**: The user is prompted to choose Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).

3. **Computer's Choice**: The computer generates a random choice (0, 1, or 2) using the random module.

4. **Gameplay**: The program compares the user's and computer's choices to determine the winner based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.

5. **Outcome**: The game announces the winner or declares a draw.

This project provides an excellent opportunity to explore randomization, lists, and conditional statements while having fun playing the classic Rock Paper Scissors game! ✊📄✂️
