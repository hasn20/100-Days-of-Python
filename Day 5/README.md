# Day 5 - Python Loops üîÑ

## Overview

In this session, we explore the concept of Python loops, specifically the `for` loop. We'll learn how to use `for` loops with lists, utilize the `range()` function, and work with the random module. The primary focus is on creating a password generator program that generates random passwords based on user input.

## Project: Password Generator üîê
![day05]()


### Description

The Password Generator project enables you to create strong and random passwords to enhance your online security. This Python program prompts you to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password. It then generates a unique password that includes a combination of these elements.

### How it Works

Here's a high-level overview of how the Password Generator works:

1. **Character Lists**: The program defines lists of characters, including letters (both lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and symbols.

2. **Welcome Message**: It displays a welcome message to the user.

3. **User Input**: The user is asked to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.

4. **Password Generation**: The program uses `for` loops and the random module to generate random characters from the defined lists. It then appends these characters to a password list.

5. **Randomization**: The characters in the password list are shuffled to randomize the order.

6. **Final Password**: The characters in the password list are combined to create the final password.

7. **Display**: The generated password is displayed to the user.

This project provides an excellent opportunity to practice Python loops, the `range()` function, list manipulation, and randomization while creating a useful tool for enhancing online security with strong passwords! üîê
