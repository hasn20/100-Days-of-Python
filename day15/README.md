### Description

The Coffee Machine project is a fun and interactive Python application that simulates a coffee vending machine. It incorporates several essential features:

1. **User Interface**: The project starts with a beautiful ASCII art logo, creating an inviting user interface.

2. **Resource Management**: The Coffee Machine manages its resources, including water, milk, coffee, and money.

3. **Coffee Menu**: It offers a coffee menu with various coffee types, each with its ingredients and cost. You can choose from espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

4. **Interactive Experience**: The project guides you through the coffee-making process, asking for your coffee selection and payment.

5. **Resource Deduction**: When you select a coffee type, the Coffee Machine checks if it has enough resources to make that coffee. If not, it informs you of the shortage.

6. **Payment Handling**: After selecting your coffee, the machine asks you to insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). If you don't have enough money, it refunds your payment.

7. **Coffee Preparation**: If you have the resources and enough money, the Coffee Machine prepares your selected coffee and serves it to you.

8. **Resources and Money Updates**: The machine updates its resources (e.g., water, milk, coffee) and money balance based on your selection and payment.

9. **Turning Off**: You can turn off the Coffee Machine at any time, and it will display a goodbye message.

10. **Resource Check**: You can check the current status of resources (water, milk, coffee) and the machine's money balance by typing 'resources' during the coffee selection process.

This project is an excellent opportunity to practice fundamental programming concepts like user input, conditional statements, loops, dictionaries, and functions.

## How to Use This Project

1. Run the `main.py` file in your Python environment to start the Coffee Machine.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select and prepare your coffee.

3. If you don't have enough money or if the machine lacks the required resources, it will inform you accordingly.

4. Enjoy your freshly brewed coffee!

Remember that you can check the resource status at any time by typing 'resources' during the coffee selection process.

## Enjoy Your Coffee!

The Coffee Machine project is not only a practical demonstration of Python skills but also a fun and engaging application. Explore the coffee menu, make selections, and savor the experience of managing your virtual coffee machine.
