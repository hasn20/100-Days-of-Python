# Day 11 - Blackjack ♠️♦️♥️♣️

## Overview

In this project, we've created a Python Blackjack game that allows you to play the classic card game against a computer dealer. The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack, where the goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.

### Description

The Blackjack game is an exciting and challenging card game that tests your strategy and luck. Here's how it works:

1. **Objective**: The objective of the game is to beat the computer dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. If your hand exceeds 21, you lose ("bust").

2. **Card Values**: Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face values, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each, and an Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the player more.

3. **Gameplay**: You and the computer dealer are dealt two cards initially. You can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand). The computer dealer follows a set of rules for drawing cards.

4. **Winning**: The player wins if they have a hand value higher than the dealer without exceeding 21 or if the dealer busts.

This project demonstrates your understanding of functions, conditional statements, loops, and randomization.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. You'll be dealt two initial cards, and the computer dealer will also have two cards.
3. Follow the prompts to decide whether to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).
4. Try to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.
5. The game will determine the winner based on the final hand values.
6. You can play multiple rounds if you like.

Enjoy playing Blackjack and see if you can outsmart the computer dealer!
