# Day 8 - Caesar Cipher üîêüìú

## Overview

In this project, we've created a simple Caesar Cipher program using Python. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique that shifts letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions to encrypt or decrypt messages.

### Description

The Caesar Cipher project allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple letter-shifting technique. Here's how the program works:

1. **Encryption**: If you choose the "encode" option, you'll be prompted to enter a message and a shift value. The program will shift each letter in the message by the specified amount and provide you with the encrypted message.

2. **Decryption**: If you choose the "decode" option, you'll enter the encrypted message and the shift value used for encryption. The program will reverse the shift to decrypt the message and display the original text.

3. **Alphabet Loop**: The program wraps around the alphabet, ensuring that shifting beyond 'z' or before 'a' still works correctly.

4. **User Interface**: The program features a user-friendly interface, including a colorful ASCII art logo for visual appeal.

5. **Restart Option**: After encrypting or decrypting a message, you have the option to restart the program to encrypt/decrypt more messages.

This project is a great introduction to working with functions, user inputs, and string manipulation in Python. It also illustrates how encryption and decryption can be implemented using a simple algorithm like the Caesar Cipher.
