# Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators üö¶

## Overview

In this session, we explore control flow and logical operators in Python. We cover essential concepts such as control flow with `if`/`else` statements, conditional operators, the modulo operator, nested `if` statements, `elif` statements, multiple `if` statements in succession, and logical operators. The main focus is on building a text-based adventure game called "Treasure Island," which involves making choices and navigating through different scenarios.

## Project: Treasure Island üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
![day03]()


### Description

The Treasure Island project challenges you to embark on an adventure to find hidden treasure. In this text-based game, you will make choices that determine your fate. You'll need to choose your path wisely as you encounter various challenges and obstacles. The game's outcome depends on your decisions, leading to either success or failure.

### How it Works

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Treasure Island game works:

1. **Introduction**: The program starts by welcoming you to Treasure Island and informing you of your mission to find the treasure.

2. **Decision-Making**: You are presented with choices that include directions (left or right) and actions (swim or wait). Your choices at each step affect the game's outcome.

3. **Outcome**: Based on your choices, the game will lead you to different scenarios, including doors of various colors. Each choice has consequences that can result in either winning the game or encountering a game over scenario.

4. **Conclusion**: The game concludes with a message indicating whether you've successfully found the treasure or if your adventure has come to an end.

This project provides an engaging way to practice control flow and logical operators in Python while having fun on a treasure hunt! Enjoy playing the Treasure Island game and making decisions that shape your destiny! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
