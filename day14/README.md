# Day 14 - Higher Lower Game Project

## Overview

In Day 14, we embark on an exciting project called the "Higher Lower Game." This project allows you to test your intuition and knowledge of social media by guessing which of two celebrities has more followers on Instagram.

### Description

The Higher Lower Game is a simple yet entertaining game that challenges you to compare the number of followers two celebrities have on Instagram. Here's how the game works:

1. At the beginning of each round, you are presented with two celebrities, "A" and "B."

2. You must decide which of the two celebrities has more followers on Instagram. You can do this by typing 'A' or 'B' as your choice.

3. If you guess correctly, your score increases by 1, and you move on to the next round. If you guess incorrectly, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

4. The game continues indefinitely until you decide to quit by making an incorrect guess.

This project introduces several key concepts and practices:

- Using a dictionary to store data: Celebrity information is stored in a Python dictionary.

- Random selection of celebrities: The game selects two random celebrities for each round.

- User input and decision-making: You, as the player, make choices to guess which celebrity has more followers.

- Scorekeeping: The game keeps track of your score as you progress through rounds.

- Clearing the console screen: The `os.system("cls")` command is used to clear the screen and create a cleaner interface.

This project is an excellent opportunity to practice using dictionaries, conditional statements, and user input handling.

## How to Use This Project

1. Run the `main.py` file in your Python environment to start the game.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the Higher Lower Game.

3. Make your choice by typing 'A' or 'B' when prompted.

4. Keep playing and challenging yourself to get a higher score!

Remember, the game can go on as long as you keep making correct guesses. When you make an incorrect guess, your final score is displayed, and you can choose to play again.

Have fun and test your celebrity follower knowledge with the Higher Lower Game!
