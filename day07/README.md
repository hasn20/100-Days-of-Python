# Day 7 - Hangman 🎮🔤

## Overview

In this project, we've created the classic word guessing game, Hangman, using Python. Players are presented with a hidden word, and they must guess one letter at a time to reveal the word. Incorrect guesses result in a hangman being drawn, and too many incorrect guesses result in a loss.

### Description

The Hangman Game project allows you to play the classic word-guessing game. Here's how the game works:

1. **Word Selection**: A word is chosen at random from a list of words provided in `hangman_words.py`. You can customize this list to include your own words.

2. **Gameplay**: You have 6 lives to guess the word correctly. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. If you lose all your lives, you lose the game.

3. **Guessing Letters**: Guess one letter at a time by entering a letter when prompted. The game will display the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters.

4. **Game Progress**: As you make correct guesses, the word will be gradually revealed. Incorrect guesses will result in losing a life and drawing the hangman.

5. **Winning or Losing**: If you guess the word correctly within 6 lives, you win the game. If not, you lose.

6. **ASCII Art**: The game includes ASCII art to depict the hangman's progression as you make incorrect guesses. The ASCII art is provided in `hangman_art.py`.

7. **User Interface**: The game features a clean and interactive user interface to enhance the gaming experience.

This project is an excellent example of breaking down a complex problem into smaller steps and creating an interactive text-based game. Customize the word list to make the game more interesting or challenging! 🎮🔤🏞️
