# Day 13 - Debugging: How to Find and Fix Errors in your Code

## Overview

In Day 13, we dive into the essential skill of debugging. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code. Every developer encounters bugs, and knowing how to debug effectively is crucial for software development. In this project, we explore various debugging techniques and practices.

## Project: Debugging Techniques

### Description

Debugging is an integral part of coding. It involves identifying and resolving issues in your code that prevent it from running correctly. Here are some key debugging techniques you'll learn in this project:

1. **Describing the Problem**: Before you can fix a bug, you need to understand it. We'll start by learning how to describe and define the problem you're facing.

2. **Reproducing the Bug**: A critical step in debugging is being able to reproduce the issue consistently. We'll discuss methods for reproducing bugs and making them easier to isolate.

3. **Playing Computer and Evaluating Each Line**: Debugging often involves tracing through your code step by step, just like a computer would. We'll practice this technique to identify the point where the code goes wrong.

4. **Squashing Bugs with a print() Statement**: One of the simplest yet effective debugging tools is using print statements to inspect variables and the program's flow. We'll use print statements to pinpoint issues.

5. **Using a Debugger**: Most integrated development environments (IDEs) offer built-in debuggers. We'll explore how to use debuggers to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code execution.

By the end of this project, you'll be better equipped to identify, isolate, and fix bugs in your code efficiently. Debugging is a valuable skill that separates novice developers from experienced ones, so it's worth mastering.

## How to Use This Project

This project does not provide a specific codebase but serves as a guide to improving your debugging skills. To apply these techniques, you can use them in your existing projects whenever you encounter issues. Remember that debugging is not about avoiding errors but about learning how to solve them effectively.

Feel free to revisit this project whenever you need a refresher on debugging techniques.

Happy debugging!
