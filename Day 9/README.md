# Day 9 - Secret Auction ü§´üí∞

## Overview

In this project, we've created a Python program for conducting a secret auction. The Secret Auction program allows users to submit their names and bid amounts secretly. Once all bids are collected, the program reveals the winner and their winning bid.

### Description

The Secret Auction program is a fun and interactive way to conduct auctions while keeping the bidders' identities and bids hidden until the end. Here's how the program works:

1. **Bidding**: Participants enter their name and the amount they want to bid in the auction.

2. **Anonymous Bidding**: Bids are kept secret from other participants. Bidders do not know the amounts bid by others.

3. **Multiple Bids**: Participants can place multiple bids one after another.

4. **End of Auction**: Once all bids are collected, the program identifies the highest bidder and reveals their name and the winning bid amount.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The program features an attractive ASCII art logo for a visually appealing user experience.

6. **Restart Option**: After announcing the winner, you have the option to restart the program to conduct more secret auctions.

This project provides hands-on experience with Python dictionaries, user input, and simple control flow. It's a creative way to simulate a real auction while maintaining anonymity among participants.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Follow the prompts to enter participant names and their respective bids.
3. Continue adding participants and bids until you're ready to reveal the winner.
4. After revealing the winner, you have the option to restart the program for another secret auction.

Have fun hosting secret auctions with your Python program!
