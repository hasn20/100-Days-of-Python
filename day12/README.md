### Description

The Number Guessing Challenge is an exciting game where you'll put your guessing skills to the test. The game starts by randomly selecting a number between 1 and 100. Your task is to guess this secret number correctly. But be careful, you have a limited number of attempts, depending on the difficulty level you choose.

### How it Works

Here's a quick rundown of how the Number Guessing Challenge works:

1. **Welcome and Logo**: The game begins with a welcoming message and a cool game logo.

2. **Choose Difficulty**: You get to choose between two difficulty levels:
   - Easy ðŸŸ¢: You have 10 attempts.
   - Hard ðŸ”´: You have 5 attempts.

3. **Make Guesses**: After selecting the difficulty level, you'll be prompted to make your first guess. The game provides feedback after each guess, letting you know if your guess is too high, too low, or if you've guessed correctly.

4. **Win or Lose**: If you guess the secret number correctly, you win the game and receive a victory message! ðŸŽ‰ If you run out of attempts, you lose, and a defeat message is displayed.

5. **Play Again**: After each game, you have the option to play again or exit the game.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to strengthen your Python skills while enjoying a classic guessing game. Have a blast and see if you can guess the secret number! ðŸ¤”ðŸ”¢
