# Day 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings ðŸ’¡

## Overview

In this session, we explore Python's data types and string manipulation techniques. We cover fundamental concepts such as Python's primitive data types, type errors, type checking, type conversion, mathematical operations, number manipulation, and F-strings. The main focus is on building a tip calculator, which is a practical application of these concepts.

### Description

The Tip Calculator project helps you calculate the appropriate tip and split the bill when dining out with friends or colleagues. You input the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill. The program then calculates how much each person should contribute, ensuring accurate and convenient bill splitting.

### How it Works

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Tip Calculator works:

1. **Welcome Message**: The program starts by welcoming the user to the tip calculator.

2. **Input Gathering**: It prompts the user to input the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill.

3. **Calculations**: The program performs the necessary calculations to determine how much each person should contribute. It considers the total bill, the tip percentage, and the number of people.

4. **Result Display**: Finally, the program displays the amount each person should pay, formatted to two decimal places for convenience.
