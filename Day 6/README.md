# Day 6 - Python Functions & Karel ðŸ¤–

## Overview

In this session, we explore Python functions and Karel, a simple programming language used for teaching purposes. We'll learn how to define and call functions in Python, understand the importance of proper indentation, work with while loops, and solve a maze escape problem using code.

## Project: Maze Escape ðŸ§©
![day06]()


### Description

The Maze Escape project challenges you to write code to help a robot navigate through a maze and reach its goal. In this program, we use Python functions to define actions for the robot, including turning and moving forward. By controlling the robot's movements, we aim to guide it to the exit of the maze.

### How it Works

Here's a high-level overview of how the Maze Escape code works:

1. **Defining Actions**: We define a Python function called `turn_right()` to make the robot turn right. This function is used to change the robot's direction within the maze.

2. **Moving Forward**: The robot continuously moves forward while the path ahead is clear.

3. **Escaping the Maze**: The primary goal is to escape the maze. The robot follows a set of rules: if the right path is clear, it turns right and moves forward; if the front path is clear, it moves forward; otherwise, it turns left.

4. **Maze Solution**: By implementing these rules and using the `turn_right()` function, the robot eventually navigates through the maze and reaches its goal.

This project offers an introduction to functions in Python and provides an interactive way to practice logical problem-solving skills by guiding a robot through a maze! ðŸ¤–ðŸ§©
